Alternatively, if you want to keep the file in the repository but make it read-only to prevent accidental changes, you can change its file permissions. This way, the file will remain in the repository, but it won't be accidentally altered.
You can change the permissions for an entire directory and its contents using the chmod command in your terminal. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Change permissions for the directory itself:

sh
chmod 755 /path/to/your/directory
This command sets the permissions to 755, which means:

Owner: Read, write, and execute

Group: Read and execute

Others: Read and execute

Change permissions for all files and subdirectories within the directory:

sh
chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/directory
The -R option stands for "recursive," which means it will apply the permissions to all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.

If you want to set different permissions, you can adjust the 755 value accordingly. For example, 700 would give full permissions to the owner and no permissions to others.

If I wanted all to be set to read and execute only, but not write. 555?
Yes, you got it! Setting the permissions to 555 will make the files and directories read and execute only, but not writable. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Change permissions for the directory itself:

sh
chmod 555 /path/to/your/directory
Change permissions for all files and subdirectories within the directory:

sh
chmod -R 555 /path/to/your/directory
The -R option stands for "recursive," which means it will apply the permissions to all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.
