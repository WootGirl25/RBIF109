    "Dr. Herrera has received tumor samples from numerous patients and is eager to explore the gene expression in a specific tumor sample. Rather than analyzing all patient samples, Dr. Herrera chose to randomly select one sample to gain preliminary insights into gene expression. His laboratory scientist processed the tumor tissues at a molecular level and dispatched a sample for NGS sequencing. The attached fastq files were returned to Dr. Herrera. Your assignment is to design an informatics workflow to analyze and report on the expressed genes in this sample. \r\n",

    " \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Initiate your bioinformatics approach by assessing the quality of the NGS fastq files. After the quality check, provide feedback on sequence quality and the number of reads present in the sample. You can employ built-in functions from Biopython for this step. Once the genes are identified, utilize a genome browser like IGV (Integrated Genome Viewer) at https://www.igv.org to visualize them. Hints: Apply the concepts learned in week 6 lectures and other relevant information to guide your analysis. (samtools, bedtools) \r\n",

    "Submit your script file along with a README. Additionally, discuss the relevance of your results in cancer biology. "
